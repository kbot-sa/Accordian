# Accordian
This is an accordion, with collapsable content

This project is part of my learning series on learning DOM Manipulation
Most of the code is from a tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fb2aPlgoys&t=7091s

However, I have made some changes to the code and added my own personal flare.
